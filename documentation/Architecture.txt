	Our project has a 3—tier architecture. It can be boiled down into the three different layers of the traditional
3—tier model, which has the presentation, logic, and data layers. At the surface, where the user interacts with the game, 
we have the presentation tier, which consists of the user making their decisions and clicking a button to make a bet or 
observing their cards to plan ahead. Once the player interacts with the game, the program moves down into the logic tier, 
where it makes decisions about what the AI will do or how the player’s funds are impacted by their decision. To make these 
logical decisions, the program needs the third and final layer, the data layer. Here, each of the classes have their values 
stored, such as the list of cards in the deck and their order, or what cards the player has in their hand. Therefore, the 
logic tier must interact with the data layer to make the necessary decisions to deliver to the presentation layer.
