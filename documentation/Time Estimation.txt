	To estimate the time it would take us to complete our project, we used the lines of code method. To begin 
our estimation, we made a rough estimate of how many lines it would take us to complete the project given the 
complexity of our project. This estimate came out to be roughly 750 lines of code. From there, we used projects 
one and two to determine how long it took us, on average, to write each line of code. Project 1 was completed in 
58 hours with roughly 870 lines of code. Project 2 was completed in 28.25 hours with roughly 375 lines of code. 
Using these two projects, we have a total of 86.25 hours and 1245 lines of code. Therefore, we estimated that it 
takes us .067 hours per line of code. Finally, our total estimation of time to complete this project is 51.6 hours.

	Upon completion, our group only took roughly 35 hours to complete this project. This is because we were more 
efficient when coding than we were in the past, which allowed us to complete the project in much less time.
