	Our group primarily used a structural design pattern. We looked at the game of poker as a whole, and broke it 
down into its individual parts, thus creating a structural view of the game. From there, we used the “composite” structural 
design pattern. We chose this because we looked at poker in a tree—like structure. Starting from the game itself, we have 
the players and our data. Coming from our players, we have our buttons and our cards. Using the composite pattern, we can 
implement this tree structure, as well as interconnect different branches of that tree. For example, the data class needs 
to interact with the card class, because it looks after the deck and the cards on the table. Furthermore, the data class also 
handles the list of players within our game. The composite pattern allows us to use these classes in a manner that allows for 
this interdependence.
